# DragonOS

**Languages** [中文](README_CN.md)|English
&nbsp;

&emsp;&emsp;DragonOS is a 64-bit operating system with a completely independent kernel, designed for lightweight cloud computing scenarios, offering Linux binary compatibility. It aims to provide lightweight, high-performance solutions for containerized workloads. Developed using Rust for enhanced reliability.

&emsp;&emsp;The DragonOS open-source community was established in July 2022 and is entirely commercially neutral. We warmly welcome interested developers and enthusiasts to join us!

&emsp;&emsp;DragonOS features excellent and comprehensive architectural design. Compared to other systems of similar scale, DragonOS supports eBPF and virtualization. Currently, we are actively advancing container support, cloud platform compatibility, RISC-V support, as well as porting compilers and application software. Our goal is to achieve large-scale production environment deployment within five years.

&emsp;&emsp;DragonOS is rapidly evolving under community-driven development. Currently, DragonOS has implemented approximately 1/4 of Linux interfaces. In the future, we will provide 100% Linux compatibility along with new features.
