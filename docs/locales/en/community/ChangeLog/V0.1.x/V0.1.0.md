## Preface

&emsp;&emsp;DragonOS has been under development since January 15, 2022, and has now gone through nearly 300 days. In these many days and nights, it's hard to count how much time has been spent on DragonOS development. I have basically given all my free time to DragonOS, and the estimated total working hours have already exceeded 1000 hours. It feels very rewarding to be able to release the first version.

&emsp;&emsp;Since July 2022, a number of friends and mentors from six universities or companies have joined the development of DragonOS. I was very happy about this. I think, with everyone's joint efforts, we can create an operating system that is truly practical! We have held 14 discussion meetings. I believe, with everyone's joint efforts, in the future, we will be able to create an independent, open, server-oriented open-source operating system that can be used in production environments.

&emsp;&emsp;Although DragonOS is currently just a toy-level operating system, it's "only slightly more difficult than a undergraduate graduation project." However, please don't underestimate it. Its internal architecture design targets Linux 5.18 and later distributions. Although it has not yet reached the level of Linux, we are working hard to catch up. Thanks to the relevant resources of Linux, DragonOS has learned a lot of design ideas from Linux during its architecture design. The related components have considered scalability and portability as much as possible.

&emsp;&emsp;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. The release of DragonOS V0.1.0 is a new beginning. **I hope, in the next ten years, we can work together with many partners, and by 2032, build DragonOS into a practical, widely used open-source operating system in the server field!**

&emsp;&emsp;**A hundred boats race, the ones who row first win; in the middle stream, the brave win.** I believe, with the continuous efforts of the community developers in the coming time, our goal will become a reality!

## Special Thanks

&emsp;&emsp;At the time of the release of DragonOS V0.1.0, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my teachers, predecessors, and school!

- **Teacher Yao Zhicheng from Dali Town Central Primary School, Nanhai District, Foshan City**: You are the guide who introduced me to computers and taught me programming. Ten years ago, when we talked, you said, "Our country currently does not have an independent and mature operating system." This sentence planted the seed of my dream. You cultivated my love for computers, so I chose the major of software engineering. Thank you for your guidance back then, I will never forget your kindness!

- **Shimen Experimental School, Nanhai District, Foshan City**: During the three years I studied at Shimen Experimental School, I am very grateful for the school's "Strength-based Education" philosophy. Under the guidance of the teachers, I was able to fully develop my personality and talents, and achieved good results. During the three years at Shimen Experimental School, I learned C++, Java, and simple algorithms, and I developed several Android apps, accumulating nearly 6,000 lines of code.

- **Shimen Middle School, Nanhai District, Foshan City**: "The road is long and the task is heavy, never forget to strive" is the school motto of Shimen Middle School. I think this motto should also become the motto of each new generation of youth. During the three years at Shimen Middle School, the education of national sentiment had a great impact on me. I think, as new generation of youth, we should shoulder the responsibility of the times, strive hard, and work for the development of the country, the strength of the nation, and the future of humanity!

- **South China University of Technology**: "Broad learning, careful thinking, clear discernment, and firm action" â€“ at SCUT, I received further learning and development. I broadened my horizons, learned to communicate with many people. Moreover, in the School of Software, I met a group of conscientious and responsible teachers. I am very grateful for the support of the school, which supported us in establishing the project group. I believe, with the support of the school, DragonOS can achieve better development and go further!

- **Professor Wang Guohua from the School of Software, South China University of Technology**: Professor Wang is my teacher for the course "Operating System". Under her guidance, I gained a deeper understanding of the principles of operating systems, and participated in the "Pan-Delta+ University Students' Computer Works Competition". In the Guangdong provincial selection in June 2022, DragonOS won the first prize and the Best Innovation Award.

- **Professor Tang Feng from the School of Software, South China University of Technology**: Professor Tang is our project group's on-campus mentor. Under her careful guidance, we will continue to move forward, keep our direction, and continuously build an open-source community. I sincerely thank Professor Tang for her guidance!

- **[Yaotian Feng](https://github.com/Codetector1374)**: I met this very capable person on Bilibili. He answered many of my questions. Many times, after I had debugged for several days without any idea, a few words from him would wake me up and help me find the path to solve the problem. He also shared with me the places where I might fall into traps, allowing me to have a psychological expectation when about to fall into a trap, so I wouldn't feel so uncomfortable, ha ha.

## Kernel

### Some Standards and Specifications Followed

- Bootloader: Multiboot2
- System Interface: POSIX 2008

### Hardware Architecture

- Currently supports running on x86-64 architecture processors

### Bootloader

- Uses Grub 2.06 as the bootloader

### Memory Management

- Implemented a bitmap-based page allocator
- Implemented a slab allocator for allocating small, aligned memory blocks
- Abstracted VMA (Virtual Memory Area)
- Implemented VMA reverse mapping mechanism
- Implemented MMIO address space auto-mapping mechanism

### Multi-core

- Supports multi-core boot. That is, after DragonOS starts, it will start the AP processor. However, to simplify the implementation of other kernel modules, currently, there are no tasks running on the AP processor.
- Roughly implemented the IPI (Inter-Processor Interrupt) framework

### Process Management

- Supports process creation and recycling
- Kernel threads
- Kthread mechanism
- User-space and kernel-space process/thread fork/vfork (note that user-space fork and kernel-space fork have some differences; kernel-space fork is more complex)
- exec allows a process to execute a new executable file
- Process timer sleep (sleep) (supports high-precision sleep with spin/rdtsc, supports sleep via context switching)

### Synchronization Primitives

- spinlock spin lock
- mutex mutex
- atomic atomic variable
- wait_queue wait queue
- semaphore semaphore

### Scheduling Related

- CFS scheduler
- Single-core scheduling (multi-core load balancing is temporarily not supported)
