Introduction to DragonOS
====================================

    DragonOS, the Dragon Operating System, is a 64-bit operating system designed for lightweight cloud computing scenarios. It features a fully self-developed kernel and provides Linux binary compatibility. Developed using the Rust programming language, it offers enhanced reliability. Currently, DragonOS ranks among the top three in the Rust operating system field on GitHub.

    The DragonOS open-source community was established in July 2022. It is completely neutral in commercial matters. Our goal is to build a fully independent, open-source, high-performance, and highly reliable server operating system, **to create a fully self-controlled digital future!**

    DragonOS has an excellent and well-designed architecture. Compared to other systems of similar size, DragonOS supports virtualization and has certain advantages in areas such as device model and scheduling subsystems. Currently, we are actively promoting cloud platform support, RISC-V support, as well as the porting of compilers and application software. We aim to achieve large-scale application in production environments within five years.

    DragonOS is currently developing rapidly under the drive of the community. At present, DragonOS has already implemented about 1/4 of the Linux interface. In the future, we will provide 100% compatibility with Linux and introduce new features.

    The goal of DragonOS is to build a fully independent, open-source, high-performance, and highly reliable server operating system, providing a completely self-controlled core power for the country's digital infrastructure construction.

    As a community-driven open-source operating system, in order to promote the development of the open-source community and avoid potential infringement by commercial companies that do not comply with open-source agreements, we have decided to open the source code under the GPLv2 license, using a strict open-source agreement to protect DragonOS.
