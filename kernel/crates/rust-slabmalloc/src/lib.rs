//! A slab allocator implementation for objects less than a page-size (4 KiB or 2MiB).
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The organization is as follows:
//!
//!  * A `ZoneAllocator` manages many `SCAllocator` and can
//!    satisfy requests for different allocation sizes.
//!  * A `SCAllocator` allocates objects of exactly one size.
//!    It stores the objects and meta-data in one or multiple `AllocablePage` objects.
//!  * A trait `AllocablePage` that defines the page-type from which we allocate objects.
//!
//! Lastly, it provides two default `AllocablePage` implementations `ObjectPage` and `LargeObjectPage`:
//!  * A `ObjectPage` that is 4 KiB in size and contains allocated objects and associated meta-data.
//!  * A `LargeObjectPage` that is 2 MiB in size and contains allocated objects and associated meta-data.
//!
//!
//! # Implementing GlobalAlloc
//! See the [global alloc](https://github.com/gz/rust-slabmalloc/tree/master/examples/global_alloc.rs) example.
